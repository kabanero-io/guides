== Developing Cloud-native applications - Codewind

=== Using a Custom Appsody Stack from Codewind

By default, Codewind has integration for the Kabanero stacks, which are 
based on the stacks released by the Appsody project. 

It is worth looking at the Codewind configuration to understand how to
eventually include references to custom stacks, such as the one we will 
be building in this workshop.

In order to include additional stacks to the list of stacks available
inside Codewind, you can add them through the template sources panel.
Right-click the Projects icon in the Codewind section of the Visual Code
Studio Explorer and select "Manage Template Sources":

Make sure you have "Kabanero Collections" enabled and "Appsody Stacks"
disabled, otherwise you may see stacks with the same name and descriptions
in the list of stack options when creating a new Codewind project.

.Codewind template sources

You’re now ready to use the Kabanero collections from within Codewind.

=== Creating a new Codewind Project

We’ve seen how the Appsody CLI helps create, build and deploy projects
based on stacks and templates. Let’s now see how Codewind augments the
Appsody experience with tools for cloud-native development.

We’re going to start by creating a new Node.js project. These first
steps are the same for all the supported project types.

To get started with writing the project, hover over the *Projects* entry
underneath *Codewind* in *Visual Studio Code* and press the *+* icon to
create a new project.

.New Codewind project 
image::/img/guide/kab-workshop-new-project.png[link="/img/guide/kab-workshop-new-project.png" alt="New Codewind project"]


You should see a list of project types you can create. Select the
`+Kabanero Collections+` group, then select `Kabanero Node.js Express simple template`.

.New Node.js Express project 
image::/img/guide/kab-workshop-codewind-new-nodejs.png[link="/img/guide/kab-workshop-codewind-new-nodejs.png" alt="New Node.js Express project"]

In the next field give the project a name, e.g `+kabanero-node-project+`

Press `+Enter+` to create the project. Codewind will prompt you for the parent location of the folder about to be created for the project. Select a folder and then click on "Select parent directory". 

The project has been generated and Codewind will start to build it. To see the progress, expand `+Codewind+` -> `+Projects+` and right click the menu options `+Show all logs+`:

After a little while you should see the following log message:

[source, role="no_copy"]
....
[Container] 
[Container] Running command:  npm start
[Container] 
[Container] > nodejs-express@0.2.8 start /project
[Container] > node server.js
[Container] 
[Container] [Mon Dec  9 16:07:14 2019] com.ibm.diagnostics.healthcenter.loader INFO: Node Application Metrics 5.1.1.201912041724 (Agent Core 4.0.5)
[Container] [Mon Dec  9 16:07:14 2019] com.ibm.diagnostics.healthcenter.mqtt INFO: Connecting to broker localhost:1883
[Container] App started on PORT 3000
....

And the state for the project should change to `+Running+`:

.Node.js Express project running
image::/img/guide/kab-workshop-codewind-nodejs-running.png[link="/img/guide/kab-workshop-codewind-nodejs-running.png" alt="Node.js Express project running"]

The generated project contains all the boiler-plate code to get started
with developing a Node.js Express application. This is the exact same
code we saw generated for the new Appsody project.

To access the application endpoint in a browser, select the *Open App*
icon next to the project’s name, or right-click on the project and
select the `+Open App+` menu option. This opens up the application in
the running container showing a welcome page for the project.

.Launch Node.js Express application
image::/img/guide/kab-workshop-codewind-launch-nodejs.png[link="/img/guide/kab-workshop-codewind-launch-nodejs.png" alt="Launch Node.js Express application"]

Let’s take a look at the code. In the *Visual Studio Code Explorer* you should see
an entry with your Codewind project name. If you don’t find
it, right-click on the project and choose `+Add Folder to Workspace+`.
In the workspace view, expand the project and the sub-folders to show
all the files created from the Appsody template (Note, the template is
not intended to be a sample as most people would end up having to delete
the code each time, it aims to provide the starter code, server
configuration and build to which you can add your code).

The main source file is *app.js*, which serves the root path of your REST API.

Let’s modify that file to add the "/resource" REST endpoint to your application:

[source,node]
----
const app = require('express')()

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello from Appsody!");
});
 
app.get('/resource', (req, res) => {
  res.send("Resource from Appsody!");
});

module.exports.app = app;
----

Any changes you make to your code will automatically be 
re-deployed by *Codewind*, and viewed in your browser.

If you still have the logs `+OUTPUT+` tab open you will see that the
code is compiled and the application restarted. You should see messages
like:

[source, role="no_copy"]
....
[Container] > nodejs-express@0.2.8 start /project
[Container] > node server.js
[Container] 
[Container] [Mon Dec  9 16:14:03 2019] com.ibm.diagnostics.healthcenter.loader INFO: Node Application Metrics 5.1.1.201912041724 (Agent Core 4.0.5)
[Container] [Mon Dec  9 16:14:04 2019] com.ibm.diagnostics.healthcenter.mqtt INFO: Connecting to broker localhost:1883
[Container] App started on PORT 3000
....

Point your browser at the new resource (note, `+<port>+` is the port
number you saw when you first opened the application):

[source, role="no_copy"]
....
http://127.0.0.1:<port>/resource
....

You should see the following response:

[source, role="no_copy"]
....
Resource from Appsody!
....

=== Looking Inside the Container

During development you may need to look inside the container to see
what’s deployed and configured. Codwind makes this easy. Select the
`+Open Container Shell+` option:

.Open Container Shell
image::/img/guide/kab-workshop-codewind-shell.png[link="/img/guide/kab-workshop-codewind-shell.png" alt="Open Container Shell"]

The following shows the files and location where the shell opens inside
the container. This is the root of your project.

.Listing application files from container shell
image::/img/guide/kab-workshop-codewind-shell-commands.png[link="/img/guide/kab-workshop-codewind-shell-commands.png" alt="Listing application files from container shell"]

You can navigate around the various directories for the application
and its dependencies.

=== Viewing Application Metrics

Let’s take a look at the application metrics built in to Codewind.
Right-click on the application and select `+Open Application Monitor+`:

This should open a page in your browser showing the metrics
dashboard with various system resource and response time data.
To make it more interesting,
hit the REST endpoint a few times to see the effects. You should end up
with a dashboard looking something like:

.Codewind Application Metrics Dashboard
image::/img/guide/kab-workshop-codewind-performance.png[link="/img/guide/kab-workshop-codewind-performance.png" alt="Codewind Application Metrics Dashboard"]

The dashboard helps you understand the runtime characteristics of your
service. Keep the dashboard open for now.

=== Running Load Tests

Let’s now take a look at the load testing support of Codewind.
Right-click on the application and select
`+Open Performance Dashboard+`:

In a browser tab you should see the Codewind performance dashboard.
Click on `+Edit load run settings+` and change the path to point to the
REST service endpoint `+/resource+` and click `+Save+` to save
the settings. Click `+Run Load Test+`, in the dialog, give the test a
name `+Test 1+` and choose `+Run+`:

.Edit load run settings
image::/img/guide/kab-workshop-codewind-edit-load-test.png[link="/img/guide/kab-workshop-codewind-edit-load-test.png" alt="Edit load run settings"]

When the tests are complete you should see results similar to the
following (you may need to click refresh in the browser). Click the
check-boxes for `+Response+`, `+Hits+`, `+CPU+` and `+Memory+`.

.Load test results
image::/img/guide/kab-workshop-codewind-performance-test.png[link="/img/guide/kab-workshop-codewind-performance-test.png" alt="Load test results"]

To see the effect of the load test on the service, take a look at the
metrics dashboard you opened earlier. You should see spikes in the
various measures.

Let’s do some development and degrade the performance of the services.
Update the `+GET+` function in `app.js` with the following content and save the file. As
before, the application will be automatically updated:

[source,java]
----
app.get('/resource', (req, res) => {
  setTimeout(function() {
    res.send("Resource from Appsody!");
  }, 3000);  
});
----

In the performance dashboard, click `+Run Load Test+`, give the test
another name, e.g. `+Test 2+`, and click `+Run+`. When the tests
complete, you should see results similar to the following:

.Load test results after performance degradation
image::/img/guide/kab-workshop-codewind-performance-test-2.png[link="/img/guide/kab-workshop-codewind-performance-test-2.png" alt="Load test results after performance degradation"]


We can see clearly from the chart that the response time has increased.
Revisit the metrics dashboard and we can also see the response time
increase:

.Application metrics after performance degradation
image::/img/guide/kab-workshop-codewind-performance-2.png[link="/img/guide/kab-workshop-codewind-performance-2.png" alt="Application metrics after performance degradation"]

=== Deploy the Project to Knative or Kubernetes via the CLI

The project you created is a normal Appsody project and so can be worked
with using the Appsody CLI. As per the Appsody part of this workshop,
deploy the application to Kubernetes using:

[.tab_link.mac_link]
`*MAC*`

[.tab_link.windows_link]
`*WINDOWS*`

[.tab_content.mac_section]
--
[source, role='command']
....
cd <parent directory location>/kabanero-node-project
appsody deploy
....
--

[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
[source, role='command']
....
cd <parent directory location>\kabanero-node-project
appsody deploy
....
--

If this was successful, the output of this command should be:

[source, role="no_copy"]
....
Deployed project running at http://localhost:<port>
....

Test the endpoint by opening:

[source, role="no_copy"]
....
http://127.0.0.1:<port>/resource
....

You should see the following response:

[source, role="no_copy"]
....
Resource from Appsody!
....

Congratulations! Your application is now accessible through Knative/Kubernetes.

You can undeploy the application using:

[source, role='command']
....
appsody deploy delete
....
